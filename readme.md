# The Gameshow Host (Monty Hall) Problem Simulator

Inspired by a scene in the film 21 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBdjqtR2iK4) and attempting to understand variable change in probability.

Great explanation of the problem on Numberphiles YT channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0

## What It Does

Running the script will allow the user to choose 1) How many doors are in the game and 2) How many games to simulate.

The games will then be simulated as if the player chooses a door, the host then opens every other door but one and then gives the player the option to switch their choice, before revealing the winning door. In the simulation, the player always opts to switch from their original choice.

The script then outputs to terminal the win/loss ratio.
